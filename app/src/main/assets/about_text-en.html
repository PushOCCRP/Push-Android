Meydan TV is a non-profit digital media platform that seeks to provide high-quality journalism, objective analysis, breaking news, and diverse opinions for and about Azerbaijan. Founded by two Azerbaijani dissidents in 2013, it is now one of the most popular and influential media outlets in Azerbaijan. In an effort to give the international community a richer and more nuanced perspective on Azerbaijan, we deliver selected news and analysis in English and in Russian.<br /><br />

We strive for impartiality and have no ties, financial or otherwise, to any special interest, political parties, or businesses. Our team is distributed across several countries and two continents, and our reporters and editors - and their families - regularly face retribution from the government as a result of their reporting. <br /><br />

Despite the unprecedented crackdown on Meydan TV and other independent Azerbaijani media, our audience continues to grow, and we have no plans to change either our editorial stance or the focus of our coverage.
