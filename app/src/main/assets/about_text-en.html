<h1>KRIK - Crime and Corruption Reporting Network</h1>

<p>Crime and Corruption Reporting Network (KRIK) is a non-profit organization established to improve the investigative journalism in Serbia. The organization was founded by a team of journalists who for years has been engaged in exposing crime and corruption, and who have received many awards for their work.</p>

<p>KRIK is part of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), an international non-profit organization that is a consortium of non-profit investigative centers and for profit independent media in twenty countries around the world, from the Balkans and Eastern Europe to Central Asia. Organizations that helped development of KRIK so far are OCCRP, The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and Open Society Foundations (OSF).</p>

<p>The focus of our work is revealing organized crime and corruption that permeates all levels of society. Our goal is to help readers to better understand how crime and corruption affect their lives. KRIK seeks to provide in-depth investigative stories, as well as the latest news in this field. Moreover, KRIK is building an online database of documents, which is a valuable resource for journalists and the public. As a member of OCCRP, KRIK is involved in cross-border research projects.</p>

<p>We are interested to help other media to develop their capacity for investigative journalism.</p>
