<p>The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) is a consortium of more than 24 non-profit investigative centers, scores of journalists and several major regional news organizations stretching from Eastern Europe to Central Asia. We teamed up in 2006 to do transnational investi-gative reporting and promote technology-based approaches to exposing organized crime and corrup-tion worldwide.</p>
<p>Our goal is to help people better understand how organized crime and corruption affect their lives. OCCRP publishes in-depth investigative stories as well as the latest news on organized crime and corruption activities in the region.</p>
<p>We have quietly become one of the world’s largest investigative reporting organizations, generating more than 60 cross-border investigations per year. Our websites inform more than 6 million readers and viewers every month, and 200 million other readers and viewers have access through legacy media which publish our work. The ever-widening impact of OCCRP stories demonstrates that when enough people possess the right kind of information they can bring about the right kind of change.</p>
<p>OCCRP also trains reporters and partners in advanced journalism techniques, builds practical, high-use tools used to improve the efficiency of reporting and publishing and is actively reinventing in-vestigative journalism to be more interactive, more effective, more impactful and relevant to readers.</p>
<h2>Our Impact</h2>
<p>Everything we do is built upon the core mission of investigative reporting and changing our societies for the better. We are one of the most effective news organizations in bringing about real change.</p>
<p>Since 2009 our reporting has led to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>US$ 2.8 billion in assets frozen or seized</strong> with governments seeking to seize an additional <strong>US$ 1 billion</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>55 criminal investigations</strong> launched as a result of its stories.</li>
<li><strong>25 calls for action</strong> by civil or international bodies.</li>
<li><strong>115 arrest warrants</strong> issued with <strong>7 subjects on the run</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>12 major sackings</strong>, including a <strong>President</strong>, <strong>Prime Minister</strong> and <strong>CEOs</strong> of major international corporations.</li>
<li><strong>Over 1,300 company closures and court decisions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>OCCRP has an outsized impact given its modest budget making it one of the most cost effective investments donors can make. Just looking at financial returns, historically OCCRP has returned more than 47,000 percent to governments through seizures and fines, an almost unheard of success.</p>
<p>Other organizations in developing countries, recognizing our achievements, seek advice, training and relationships with us. &nbsp;This, in turn, helps to build relationships between member centers far beyond their borders and allows them to leverage their international reporting more effectively.</p>
<h2>Our Supporters</h2>
<p>OCCRP is supported by grants by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), the United States Department of State, the Swiss Confederation, the Open Society Foundations (OSF), Google Ideas and the Knight Foundation.</p>

<h2>Our Current Projects</h2>
<p>Besides its regular investigative and daily reporting, OCCRP is regularly involved in a number of projects including:</p>
<p><em><strong>Training &amp; Capacity Building</strong></em></p>
<p>Capacity building and training for skills, standards and security are at the core of the OCCRP's activities. We are teamed up with the Stockholm School of Economics Media program in Riga to offer world class investigative reporting, safety, management and other trainings.</p>
<p>OCCRP provides specialized training and consulting to partners like ARIJ, Connectas and its member organizations to build a thriving international network of investigative reporters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our reporters and editors are in high demand around the world for their expertise and wanted as speakers and trainers, being asked to participate in more than 50 events a year, in locations ranging from Iceland to Brazil.</p>
<p>This international influence comes solely from the practice of core journalism skills. The Panama Papers project conducted in partnership with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has garnered international attention and impact. Our YanukovychLeaks reporters experienced worldwide interest in how they discovered and uploaded the documents that were hurled into an ornamental lake as the outgoing president fled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, OCCRP's top-of-the line Tech Team trains reporters in information and communication security giving them an edge over criminals and hostile governments.</p>
<p><em><strong>Research</strong></em></p>
<p>Our members collaborate extensively with journalists from international media on individual stories, enabling them to access the information they need via our research tools. We work with reporters in Africa, the Middle East, South and Central America, the Pacific, and North America as well as dozens of media in Europe through to Central Asia.</p>
<p>OCCRP has developed online research resources for journalists such as <a href="https://investigativedashboard.org/" target="_blank">Investigative Dashboard (ID)</a>. ID provides international reporters with access to OCCRP’s investigative research team via a simple web interface.</p>
<p>OCCRP designed ID as a transnational collaborative effort to help journalists and civil society researchers. ID hosts three core tools: a crowd-sourced database of information and documents on persons of interest and their business connections, a worldwide list of online databases and business registries, and a research desk where journalists can go for help in sourcing hard to find information.</p>
<p>Within ID, the OCCRP Tech Team has developed <a href="https://data.occrp.org/" target="_blank">ID Search</a>, a growing research database of public information documents gathered from sources around the world launched in 2016. The Tech Team is regularly collecting open source public data such as court documents, property records, leaks, government reports, asset declarations by public officials, political financing data, and much more.</p>
<p><em><strong>Technology Development</strong></em></p>
<p>OCCRP has a staff of more than a half dozen programmers and system IT specialists that help our members and partners by developing new tools, providing infrastructure support and research and development.</p>
<p>Our Tech Team works directly with reporters spearheading innovation and use technology to support investigative journalism. For example, the team assisted the YanukovychLeaks reporters in digitizing hundreds of thousands of documents ex-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych sought to destroy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tech Support &amp; Information Security</strong></em></p>
<p>OCCRP's Tech Team provides information security, infrastructure maintenance, and rapid response teams to react to threats and attacks against our partners while developing tools and resources for journalists. They also design the OCCRP's websites and project pages and help partners protect their sources through an array of tools and applications, such as <a href="/occrpleaks/" target="_blank">OCCRP Leaks</a>, allowing sources to securely leak information and documents to us.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tools</strong></em></p>
<p>The Tech Team also works with OCCRP's partner centers in developing tools for their websites and stories including a mobile publishing tool and a syndication system that is currently under development.</p>
<p>OCCRP has also developed <a href="https://vis.occrp.org/" target="_blank">Visual Investigative Scenarios (VIS)</a>, a data visualization platform designed to assist investigative journalists, activists and others in mapping complex business or crime networks. VIS provides professionally designed, customizable, dynamic html5 visualization templates to illustrate entities, networks and complex configurations of data.</p>
<h2>We Are Reinventing the Way Journalism is Done</h2>
<p>At the dawn of the “<a href="http://gijn.org/2016/06/20/a-golden-age-of-global-muckraking/" target="_blank">golden age of global muckraking</a>,” OCCRP is innovating the way we use technology to increase efficiency in finding and connecting information on crime and corruption at a global level. With over 60 investigative stories published per year, more than any other news outlet in the world, we are major source of change in our world. &nbsp;But we are also reinventing &nbsp;investigative journalism as we seek ways to amplify social and political impact, improve the reader experience and interactivity with information, increase story output and research efficiency, keep reporters safer and protect our sources better.</p>
<p>OCCRP is thinking ahead in new ways of making investigative journalism more efficient and effective as we collaborate across borders.</p>
<p>Our successes are ultimately driven by our people: our reporters, editors, fact-checkers, researchers and IT experts that make our work possible. OCCRP is breeding a new generation of investigative journalists and we will continue evolving the profession as a whole into the future.</p>
