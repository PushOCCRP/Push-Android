</p>
<p>Our goal is to help the people of the region better understand how organized crime and corruption affect their lives. OCCRP seeks to provide in-depth investigative stories as well as the latest news pertaining to organized crime and corruption activities in the region. In addition to the stories, OCCRP is building an online resource center of documents related to organized crime including court records, laws, reports, studies, company records and other public documents that will be an invaluable resource center for journalists and the public alike.</p>
<p>The OCCRP project has been, or is, supported by grants from the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Open Society Foundations. Also on this site are projects funded in part or done in partnership with other organizations including SCOOP, the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).</p>
<p>OCCRP is a registered name of the Journalism Development Network, a Maryland-based charitable organization (501(c)3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>OCCRP has been one of the most effective news organizations in bringing about real change.</h3>
<p><strong>Since its founding its reporting has led to:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Law enforcement froze or seized more than <strong>$1.2 billion</strong> in assets</li>
    <li>Tax authorities found <strong>$600 million</strong> in hidden assets</li>
    <li>Competent authorities closed more than <strong>1,000</strong> companies</li>
    <li>Law enforcement investigated, indicted or arrested over <strong>70</strong> persons – including an ex-president</li>
    <li><strong>Ten</strong> government officials resigned or were sacked – including a prime minister</li>
    <li>Governments changed <strong>20</strong> laws, rules or regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>Our total budget during this time was $5.2 million.</p>
